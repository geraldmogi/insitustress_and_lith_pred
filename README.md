# in-situ stress prediction

This repository contains 2 well datasets, LostHill and Xeek Well. For LosHill dataset, we use it to predict Maximum Horizontal Stress magnitude. For Xeek Well, we use it to predict lithology. This two project using Random Forest model for prediction. Addtional, i created a python script for calculating overburden stress using density log and also i created machine learning model to predict porosity using well log data.
